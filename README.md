# K-12 Azure Student and Educator Resources
Azure Education can include a number of different areas. This repository will be kept up to date with various projects and lessons that are likely to be a good fit for novices in the K-12 space. Some of these resources are targetted for undergraduate students, but upper high school would still greatly benefit from them!

# Past and Upcoming Events
## Student Zone at Build 2020
In May 2020, Microsoft Build had a session track specifically aimed at student developers. The target age for our student developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping the content we create for you. So if you're a bit outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content useful for your coding journey! This may be perfect for you if you're a career switcher or a even just a beginner! Find resources and videos of the sessions from the [Student Zone here](https://github.com/microsoft/StudentsAtBuild).

## MSPInspire
A group of students from the Microsoft Student Partner community including two speakers here ([Salman](https://twitter.com/salmanmkc) and [Sabiha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabiha-shaik/)) organise and run weekly events on the MSPInspire YouTube channel which gets students invovled with new technologies, trying to inspire them to become learners and grow their skillsets.

Some of the events they run include talks with Imagine Cup finalists, MVPs, Microsoft employees, etc.

Learn new concepts at your speed and on your schedule. Start here to develop practical skills through fun, interactive modules and paths. Plus, educators can get access to Microsoft classroom materials and curriculum. Check out all of the Microsoft Learn [paths and resources](http://aka.ms/learnforstudents).

## Microsoft Learn about Space Exploration

Inspired by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/about.html) and space exploration, we have released 3 new Microsoft Learn modules teaching data science and machine learning with a space-like theme. Learn more for free on the [Microsft Learn space exploration page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/topics/nasa).

## Introduction to AI
As part of [Microsoft TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals), we offer a 4-week project for students to experiment with Azure Cognitive Services. Students
can quickly start exploring how these services can give insight to complex data such as images. Visit the project
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/k12/tree/main/Teals/README.md)

## Image Data Predicting Climate Change
In collaboration with [HackingSTEM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/education-workshop/activity-library.aspx) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/about.html), we have a introduction to Machine Learning for middle and high school students. With
Excel and a simple web app, students can learn about how color in images can help us understand how our climate is changing, 
and then mimic a machine learning model to understand how Azure helps do this at scale. Check out the lesson [here](https://preview.education.microsoft.com/hackingStem/lesson/nv3zo6ad) and the machine learning demo [here](https://nasa-on-azure.azurewebsites.net/)
