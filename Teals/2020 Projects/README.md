# 2020 Azure Cognitive Services Project
Azure Cognitive Services are a set of intelligent algorithms that give your apps the power to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret what your users need through natural communication. Basically, the ability to easily add AI to any simple application youâ€™re building. 

## Learning Goals
With this project, we aim to provide an exciting alternative to the current end-of-year curriculum which allows students to combine Azure AI libraries with interactive animations, and game development, culminating in a self-led student project that integrates basic computer vision, voice recognition, and/or text analytics.

Throughout this TEALS project, students will be able to explore Azure Cognitive Services to create their own creative interactive web-based project. Students will be exposed to:
- JavaScript
- Azure Cognitive Services
- API Keys
- Animation/Game Development
- Ethics of AI

## Overview of Student Deliverables
You can find an overview of the curriculum in the [TEALS Curriculum Outline PDF here](TEALS-Curriculum-Outline.pdf).

## Demos and Example Projects
The 2020 TEALS Project uses a free-in-browser software called [The Wick Editor](https://www.wickeditor.com/#/). With this software, students can quickly create animations and interactive games with some creativity and a bit of JavaScript. 

You can find demos of both Wick Editor and Azure Cognitive Services integrations in the [Demos folder](Demos/) in this repository. 

You can also find an example project for each of the four Azure Cognitive Services APIs introduced in this project (Image, Speech, Text Sentiment, and Video Emotion) in the [Example Projects folder](https://github.com/microsoft/k12/tree/main/Teals/2020%20Projects/Example%20Projects) in this repository. 

Finally, you can find video explanations here:
